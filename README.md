# SummerProject2020
Codes from my projects during summer 2020  (C#, JavaScript, CSS, PHP and HTML).
During 6 weeks of summer 2020 I have been working on building an Operator Simulation game and a dashboard for sensor-data. 

## The Operator Simulation Game:

The game is a simplified representation of how an operator in the metal-industry works to secure correct kA on electrodes in a furnace to produce a desired amount of metal. 
The project is created in Visual Studio Code, with JavaScript, PHP, CSS and HTML-code. 
It was first connected to a database hosted locally on MySQL, but later deployed to a remote server using Infitity Free (https://infinityfree.net/) and FileZilla (FTP Client).
The game (and a somewhat detailed description of how to play it) can be found on: _operatorgame.epizy.com_.

## The dashboard: 

The dashboard is a simple userfriendly visualization of data retrieved from sensors which measures the height of dust in some dust-silos on an industrial site. 
The project in created in Visual Studio Code using C#, JavaScript, CSS and HTML-code. 
Google Charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery) is implemented for the charting. 
The main idea of the dashboard is to get a quick and easy overview of how much dust there is in the silos, as well as a prognosis of when the silos would be full.
The solution was later added to an already existing program.
